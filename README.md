## IRCBridge 2.0 - An advanced IRC plugin for bukkit.
----
IRCBridge was originally created by FunnyMan3595 (https://github.com/FunnyMan3595) and PrecipiceGames (https://github.com/PrecipiceGames), I give them all credit for the origins of this plugin. ;)
I have simply cleaned up this plugin and added some things.

----
##New Features:
- Console log colors.
- Better IRCd support.
- Native prefixes and suffixes for both IRC and MC users. (PermissionsEx is required, vault will be coming soon.)
- Native bukkit "JavaPlugin" support, only dependency required is PermissionsEx
- Cleaner: Plugin has been seperated into classes.

##To Do:
+ Add vault support.
+ Convert to PircBotX.
+ ~~Seperate the plugin into classes. (WIP)~~
